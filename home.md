# Time to Learn Things
This humble little repo is for documenting the resources and path I'm meandering along as I learn programming for work and play. I have no idea if this will be useful to anyone else, but I'm hoping it'll help me keep a clear record of my goals and my progress along the way.

## Background
I've been interested in code since thumbing through an outdated book on web design at my public library in elementary school. For the last ten years, I've been able to wing it through basic HTML and CSS, later graduating to dabbling in jQuery and Bootstrap to get content work done for my day job and for a few freelance clients. I know what `ints` and `Strings` and `functions` are, I feel fairly comfortable in Unix/Linux command line, I can make edits to existing pages and scripts without too much trouble, but I want to get into more from-the-ground up stuff. Building websites. Machine learning. Generative art. Weird OS scripts for when I'm lazy.

## What I Already Know
* **HTML Basics** (semantic tags, responsive images, linking to scripts and stylesheets, relative vs. absolute linking)
* **CSS Basics** (selectors, setting dimensions and colors, pseudo-classes, basic media queries)
* **Programming Basics** (the usual data types/variables, basic type coercion, loops, conditionals)
* **Python Basics** (applying programming basics, halfway decent understanding of using documentation to work with new libraries)
* **JavaScript Bare Minimum** (programming basics, basic DOM reading/manipulation)
* **High-Level Architechture** (what a server is, client-side vs. server-side, APIs, CDNs, basic factors of performance)

## Goals
I don't know everythign I don't know, so I expect this to change often.
* **Master JavaScript, learn libraries**
  * Fluency with vanilla JS to equip a site with basic interactivity, build simple user experiences, and actually understand what I'm cloning/forking/copying and pasting when I'm not writing everything from scratch
  * Knowledge of the language that's comprehensive enough that I know what to Google and I understand what in the hell I find when I do
  * Thorough understanding of APIs
  * High competency with libraries for UI, data vizualization, and creative coding
  * Wriute idiomatic, well-structured code...don't bullshit stuff together with programming practices that are hard to debug/reuse/improve
  * Competency with one of the big UI libraries: probably React, though kinda also interested in Vue.
  * Be able to use Node and popular NPM projects like Gulp and Handlebars to run a server, build and deploy projects, template websites, and talk to other servers and services
* **Master CSS**
  * Comprehensive knowledge of Flexbox and Grid
  * Comprehensive knowledge of media queries and other responsive design best practices
  * Become good enough with vanilla CSS that I don't need Bootstrap
  * Dabble in SASS?
* **Intermediate-Level Python**
  * Write fairly idiomatic ("Pythonic") code
  * Have a decent grasp of object-oriented programming principles
  * Fluency with web scraping, basic data manipulation, and implementing APIs
  * Write utility scripts for work, like a status checker for a remote web server
  * Moderate knowledge of automating some OS-level tasks
  * Scripting for 3D applications/game engines like Blender and Unreal
  * Dabble in machine learning (mostly for artsy/goofy shit) via TensorFlow/Keras
  * Maybe dabble in Django for backend??
* **Be a good member of the community**
  * Learn how to use Git and GitHub well enough that I don't look like a total fool
  * At some point, give back by answering questions on Stack Overflow; help people who are now where I was five years ago with all this stuff
  * Possibly find some open source projects to which I can contribute
